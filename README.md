### Snips action code for the Weather app

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snipsco/snips-action-weather.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snipsco/snips-action-weather)

## Setup

Prepare your node environment on your Pi.

This action needs `nodejs` version 10 at minimum and recent version of npm.

On your pi, install a recent version of node and npm:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
npm install -g npm@latest
```

On your desktop, install the skill using sam:

```
sam install actions -g https://github.com/snipsco/snips-action-weather     
```



```sh
# Install the dependencies, builds the action and creates the config.ini file.
sh setup.sh
```

Don't forget to edit the `config.ini` file.

To be able to make calls to the API, you must have a [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) (5 day / 3 hour forecast).

An assistant containing the intents listed below must be installed on your system. Deploy it following [these instructions](https://docs.snips.ai/articles/console/actions/deploy-your-assistant).

## Run

- Dev mode:

```sh
# Dev mode watches for file changes and restarts the action.
npm run dev
```

- Prod mode:

```sh
# 1) Lint, transpile and test.
npm start
# 2) Run the action.
npm run launch
```
